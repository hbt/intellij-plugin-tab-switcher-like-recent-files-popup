# Tab Switcher Like Recent Files Popup

Adds a tab switcher that behaves like Recent Files or Recent Edited files popup in order to use key completion


## Why?

Current tab switcher disappears too quickly when using Ctrl+Tab. 
You can hold the key and press Tab to move up/down the list of tabs but it is not enough.

This reuses the same Switcher as `Recent files` which allows the user to press a key to quickly select tab or filter.
